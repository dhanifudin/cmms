## Core Entities

### 1. Geographic Structure
- **Terminal**: 116 physical locations
- **Region**: 8 regional groupings of terminals

### 2. Users & Roles
| Role | Key Permissions |
|------|----------------|
| **Admin** | Create/configure Work Orders, manage inventory, configure pricing/penalties, manage users |
| **Supervisor** | Approve Work Orders, modify Work Order details, assign workers, review completions, configure pricing/penalties |
| **Leader** | TBD - permissions not yet defined |
| **Worker (Pekerja)** | Submit before/after documentation, complete assigned Work Orders |

**Notes**:
- Admin & Supervisor can both assign workers to Work Orders
- Supervisor (PertaMC) and Supervisor (PatraNiaga) have identical permissions
- Workers and Admin authenticated via Talenta HRIS
- Supervisors and Leaders authenticated via Idaman SSO

### 3. Work Order Hierarchy
**Structure**: 
- Dynamic tree with unlimited depth
- Admin-configurable categories based on maintenance scope

**Example**:
```
Pipeline Maintenance (Category)
  └─ Gas Pipeline System (Sub-category)
      ├─ Pipeline Pressure Test (Task)
      └─ Gas Leak Detection (Task)

Pump & Compressor Maintenance (Category)
  └─ Gas Compressor Unit (Equipment)
      ├─ Monthly Compressor Inspection (Task)
      └─ Lubrication System Service (Task)

Safety System Maintenance (Category)
  └─ Fire & Gas Detection (Sub-category)
      ├─ Gas Detector Calibration (Task)
      └─ Emergency Valve Test (Task)
```

**Assignment Rules**:
- Work Orders can be assigned at any hierarchy level
- Default: Parent assignment creates one Work Order with children as sub-tasks
- Optional: Admin can split hierarchy into separate Work Orders
- Each sub-task has independent checklist, photos, and notes

### 4. Work Order Fields
**Core Fields**:
- Title/Name
- Description
- Location (Terminal/Region)
- Maintenance Type: Preventive or Corrective
- Assigned Worker (Pekerja) - individual only, no team assignments
- Priority: Custom/configurable levels
- Start Date: When worker can begin
- Due Date: Completion deadline
- Estimated Duration: Minimum time between before/after submissions

**Dynamic Fields**:
- Custom additional fields per Work Order type
- Configurable by Admin/Supervisor
- Examples: Temperature readings, equipment IDs, specific measurements

### 5. Maintenance Types

**Preventive Maintenance**:
- Proactive, scheduled before equipment failure
- Follows recurring schedules
- Standard checklists

**Corrective Maintenance**:
- Reactive, responds to failures/issues
- Two subtypes:
  - Planned: Uses standard checklists (similar to preventive)
  - Incidental: Custom/ad-hoc checklists based on specific incident

### 6. Scheduling
**Types**:
- **Monthly**: Recurring every month
- **Weekly**: Recurring every week
- **Custom**: Admin-defined recurrence pattern
- **One-time**: Non-recurring task

**Recurring Behavior**: TBD - auto-generation rules not yet defined

## Work Order Lifecycle

### Status Flow
```
Draft
  ↓ (Admin creates)
Pending Approval
  ↓ (Supervisor approves & assigns worker)
Assigned
  ↓ (Start Date arrives, worker submits BEFORE docs)
In Progress
  ↓ (Worker completes, submits AFTER docs)
Submitted for Review
  ↓ (Supervisor reviews)
Completed / Rejected / Revision Required
```

### Detailed Workflow

**1. Creation & Approval**
```
Admin creates Work Order
  - Fills core fields (title, location, dates, priority, etc.)
  - Optionally assigns worker
  - Submits for approval
    ↓
Supervisor reviews
  - Can modify Work Order details
  - Can assign/reassign worker (if not assigned)
  - Actions:
    • Approve → Work Order moves to "Assigned"
    • Reject (with reason) → Returns to Admin for revision
```

**2. Worker Execution**
```
Work Order assigned to Worker
  ↓
Worker waits until Start Date
  ↓
Worker submits BEFORE documentation:
  - Multiple photos (unlimited)
  - Text notes
  - Checklist items (specific to this task/sub-task)
  → Status automatically becomes "In Progress"
  ↓
Worker performs maintenance work
  ↓
Worker submits AFTER documentation:
  - Multiple photos (unlimited)
  - Text notes
  - Same checklist items (completed state)
  → Status becomes "Submitted for Review"

**Validation Rule**: 
- Minimum time between BEFORE and AFTER = Estimated Duration
- If submitted early → System allows but flags for supervisor review
```

**3. Supervisor Review**
```
Supervisor reviews submitted work
  - Reviews photos, notes, checklist
  - Reviews flagged early completions
  
Actions:
  • Approve → Work Order status = "Completed" ✓
  • Reject → Send back to worker (redo work)
  • Request Revision (with comments) → Worker fixes issues
  • Reassign → Assign to different worker (rare)
  
Rework approach: Depends on supervisor instruction
  - May need to redo entire work (new before + after)
  - Or just resubmit after documentation
```

### Penalties
**Trigger**: Work Order not completed/approved by Due Date
**Calculation**: Penalty if final approval timestamp > Due Date

**Methods** (configurable by Admin/Supervisor):
- **Per Item**: Fixed amount × days overdue
  - Example: Rp 750,000/day overdue
- **Percentage**: Base amount × percentage × days overdue
  - Base can be: labor cost, total Work Order value, etc.
  - Example: 5% of labor cost per day

**Configuration**:
- Dynamic/flexible approach
- Different rules per Work Order type, priority, or terminal/region
- Applied at invoice generation

**Responsibility**: TBD - who bears penalty (worker/supervisor/terminal) not defined

---

## Checklist System

### Structure
**Checklist Items** can be:
- Yes/No/NA
- Numeric value (with unit)
- Text input
- Dropdown selection
- Rating scale
- Other custom types

**Properties**:
- Required vs Optional flag
- Conditional logic: TBD - if supported
- Linked to specific task/sub-task

### Before & After Behavior
- **Same checklist items** used for both states
- Worker fills before state → performs work → fills after state
- Allows comparison of conditions

**Example**:
```
Checklist: "Gas Compressor Preventive Maintenance"

BEFORE submission:
  □ Suction Pressure: 15 PSI
  □ Discharge Pressure: 45 PSI
  □ Oil Level: Low
  □ Vibration Level: Normal
  □ Gas Leak Detection: No leaks

(Worker performs maintenance)

AFTER submission:
  ☑ Suction Pressure: 16 PSI
  ☑ Discharge Pressure: 48 PSI
  ☑ Oil Level: Normal (topped up)
  ☑ Vibration Level: Normal
  ☑ Gas Leak Detection: No leaks
```

### Management
- Admin/Supervisor create checklist templates

## 🚨 Incomplete Implementation Analysis

### Overview
While the CMMS application demonstrates **85% feature completeness** with excellent architectural foundation, several critical integration points require completion before production deployment. This section documents gaps identified through comprehensive codebase review.

### 🔴 Critical Implementation Gaps (Production Blockers)

#### 1. Photo Upload System - BACKEND MISSING
**Status**: Frontend Complete, Server Integration Missing  
**Impact**: HIGH - Workers cannot complete documentation workflow

**Current State**:
- ✅ UI fully implemented in `DocumentationModal.vue` (lines 117-142)
- ✅ File validation (type, 10MB limit) 
- ✅ Camera capture support (`capture="environment"`)
- ✅ Preview grid with captions
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Photos only stored as `URL.createObjectURL()` (memory only)
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: No server upload or persistence
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Photo data not sent to work order store

**Files Requiring Changes**:
- `/src/components/workorder/DocumentationModal.vue` (lines 444-470)
- `/src/stores/workorder.ts` - Add photo upload service integration
- Backend: Implement file upload endpoint and storage

#### 2. Authentication Integration - HARDCODED USER IDs  
**Status**: Critical System Integrity Issue  
**Impact**: HIGH - Multi-user system cannot function properly

**Found Issues** (14+ instances):
```typescript
// Examples of hardcoded values requiring auth store integration:
src/stores/template.ts:328     - createdBy: 'current-user'  
src/stores/template.ts:1277    - approvedBy: 'current-user'
src/stores/category.ts:310     - createdBy: 'current-user'
src/stores/category.ts:585     - exportedBy: 'current-user'
```

**Required Fix**: Replace all `'current-user'` with `authStore.currentUser.id`

#### 3. Work Order Material Consumption Integration
**Status**: Data Flow Broken  
**Impact**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Inventory tracking inaccurate

**Issue Location**: `/src/stores/template.ts:465`
```typescript
// TODO: Integrate with work order store to check usage
```
- Work orders specify material requirements
- Inventory exists but no automatic stock deduction
- Invoice material costs calculated but stock not updated

### 🟡 Medium Priority Gaps (Limits Functionality)

#### 4. Export/PDF Generation - STUBS ONLY
**Files**: `/src/composables/useDataExport.ts` (lines 335, 345)
```typescript
console.warn('Excel export not implemented, falling back to CSV');
console.warn('PDF export not implemented, falling back to text format');
```

#### 5. Template Usage Analytics - SYNC MISSING  
- Templates track `lastUsed` timestamp
- No synchronization with actual work order completions
- Usage statistics may be inaccurate

#### 6. Category Deletion Safety - DEPENDENCY CHECK MISSING
**File**: `/src/stores/category.ts:444`
```typescript
// TODO: Check for existing templates in this category
```
- Can delete categories with dependent templates
- Risk of orphaned template references

#### 7. Stock Adjustment Implementation
**File**: `/src/views/inventory/InventoryList.vue:403`
```typescript
// TODO: Implement stock adjustment modal
```

### 🟢 UI/UX Polish Items (Enhancement Level)

#### 8. Advanced Features Stubs
- **Global Search**: `/src/components/CommandPalette.vue:306` - TODO implementation
- **Help System**: `/src/composables/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts:127` - TODO dialog
- **Notifications Panel**: `/src/components/layout/AppHeader.vue:164` - TODO dropdown
